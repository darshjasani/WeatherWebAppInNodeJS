# WeatherWebAppInNodeJS
This is a simple yet interesting Weather Web App which displays the current temperature with the description of the weather in a card.


I have used OpenWeatherMap API to get the details of current temperature of my city. Then I have parse the API data in JSON format and have replace the content in home.html file.

In addition to that, this card will have today's Temperature, Date, Time, Min_Temperature, Max_Temperature and also today's weather descriptions like clear sky or rain or sunny and it have different day and night icon in it.

So at day the icon will be according to the description and same applies to night as well.

If you have any doubt, feel free to contact me

Stay Safe and Stay Healthy :)
